# Recommendation_Engine
Working through a basic Recommendation Engine (https://rpubs.com/jeknov/movieRec)


This project utilises R package [recommenderlab](https://github.com/mhahsler/recommenderlab) to create a simple recommendation engine for movies within the [MovieLens dataset](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest).


Questions to try and answer/general musings:
* What different methods are there for recommendation engines? What are their strengths/weaknesses?
* How do we measure how 'good' a recommendation engine is? 
* Is there some way to incorporate some sort of feedback loop into the algorithm?
* How do we choose the algorithm to use? There are many options within recommenderlab, how do we distinguish between them?
* The example this is based on only uses movies.csv and ratings.csv. How would you best incorporate tags.csv and links.csv?
